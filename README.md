# Next.js with TypeScript example
## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps. It includes `@material-ui/core` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in Material-UI v5. If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://next.material-ui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## The link component

Next.js has [a custom Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).
The example folder provides adapters for usage with Material-UI.
More information [in the documentation](https://next.material-ui.com/guides/routing/#next-js).
